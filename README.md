# Reverser

Takes a string from a form input and reverses the characters for the output.

## Requirements:

Build an HTML page that takes an input string and outputs the reverse string.

CSS in Head of HTML.

Javascript in-line at bottom of body.

HTML/CSS decisions are up to you but don't crash the page.

Include Reverse button as well as a Reset button.

Display both the input and output for comparisons.

You can reverse onChange of input or onSubmit, up to you.

## Grading Rubric(UI/UX):

1. Self explanatory: Build so anyone knows what's happening.

2. Code is clean, comments welcome.

## Tips:

Scope string size to be less than 200 characters.

Take control of input box.(textContent not innerHtml too)

Validate and error handling.

Countdown of string remaining length is a plus! Freeze cursor when full.
